# Tableau-Super-Store-Project


## Tableau Super Store Analysis and Visualization

My Tableau project aimed at analyzing and visualizing data from a super store. The project includes the creation of interactive dashboards to provide insights into the store's performance and top-selling products.

### Overview Dashboard

The Overview Dashboard serves as the main landing page and provides a high-level view of the store's performance. It includes the following features:

- Three filters (KPI, Year, State) that dynamically affect all dashboards.
- Each tile has a grey border and contains a dynamic title and measure (Sales, Profit, Quantity).
- A separate line indicates the change percentage for the selected year compared to the previous year.
- Dynamic sentences indicate the growth or decline from the previous year.
- All sheets are filtered to show data for the United States only.
- The three lower tiles are filtered by segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

### Performance Dashboard

The Performance Dashboard dives deeper into the store's performance, providing insights on various metrics. The dashboard includes the following elements:

- Six filters (KPI, Year, State, Segment, Category, Sub-Category) that dynamically affect the charts.
- Each presents a specific analysis.
- Chart #1 showcases the dynamic monthly trend for multiple measures.
- Chart #2 displays the distribution of order priority by several measures.
- Chart #3 visualizes the distribution of ship mode by several measures.
- Each chart includes a dynamic title for the selected measure and year.

### Top 10 Dashboard

The Top 10 Dashboard focuses on the top-selling countries and states, providing valuable insights into sales performance. The dashboard includes the following components:

- Four filters (Year, Segment, Category, Sub-Category) that dynamically affect the charts.
- Each chart has a grey border and presents relevant data.
- Chart #1 highlights the top 10 countries by sales.
- Chart #2 showcases the top 10 states by sales, based on the selection from Chart #1.
- Gridlines have been removed to improve visualization clarity.

Please refer to the Tableau workbook in this repository to explore the dashboards and gain a deeper understanding of the super store's performance.
